<h2>Setting up your SubDomain</h2>
<p>1-Set up your own SubDomain on <a class="color-lines-green">StateU.org</a> and install a dedicated instance of WordPress to be used just for this course.<br>
2-it is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using<br>
Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters<br>
3-as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page<br>
editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text<br>
4- and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by<br>
accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)</p>
